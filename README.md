# Dictionary
Implemented Dictionary using Tries Data Structure in CPP. 

As there are many advantages of using tries data structure . Main advantage of trie is searching a key .This can be done be in O( length_of_key ) which is very fast in compare to naive search where we check for every word in our collections that it matches with key. Tries is basically memory optimization of hash-map . 

We will store all the words and their meaning in the dictionary using Tries Data Structure . Now whenever user enters a word he need to look up in the dictionary  , our algorithm will find the meaning of that word if that exists and if not it will tell user that word doesn't exist.
